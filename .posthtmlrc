Additionally, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that PLUTO lists 263 properties under 33 variations of “Trustees of Columbia”. The article has been updated to say PLUTO lists 252 properties under 32 variations of “Trustees of Columbia.” The original number included a property under the name “Columbia Presbyterian.” This article initially included a property listed as 17 Smith Street as a listing of institutional real estate in New York City; the updated article removed 17 Smith Street after Spectator received information suggesting the address listed refers to a 17 Smith Street in Englewood, New Jersey. </i><i>A previous version of the article contained a graphic that worked under the premise that the sites listed in the ARC Site Pivot Tree were property holdings (including partial leases of buildings).
